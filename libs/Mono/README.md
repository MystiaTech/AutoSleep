# 📂 libs/Mono/

Place the **Mono version** of Assembly-CSharp.dll here!

## Where to get it:

1. Make sure Schedule I is on the **main branch** (not "alternate")
2. Run Schedule I once with MelonLoader installed
3. Close the game
4. Navigate to:
   ```
   Steam/steamapps/common/Schedule I/MelonLoader/Il2CppAssemblies/
   ```
5. Copy `Assembly-CSharp.dll` to THIS folder

## What is this for?

This DLL contains all the game's code that we need to reference when building the Mono version of the mod.

The Mono version is used when playing Schedule I on the main game branch.
