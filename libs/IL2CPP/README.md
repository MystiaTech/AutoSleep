# 📂 libs/IL2CPP/

Place the **IL2CPP version** of Assembly-CSharp.dll here!

## Where to get it:

1. Switch Schedule I to the **"alternate" beta branch** in Steam
2. Run Schedule I once with MelonLoader installed
3. Close the game
4. Navigate to:
   ```
   Steam/steamapps/common/Schedule I/MelonLoader/Il2CppAssemblies/
   ```
5. Copy `Assembly-CSharp.dll` to THIS folder

## What is this for?

This DLL contains all the game's code that we need to reference when building the IL2CPP version of the mod.

The IL2CPP version is used when playing Schedule I on the "alternate" beta branch.

## Note:

It's the SAME filename as the Mono version, but the internal structure is different! That's why we keep them in separate folders.
